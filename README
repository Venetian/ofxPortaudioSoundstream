This project is an add-on class version of ofSoundStream that employs PortAudio, based on the ofxSoundstream add-on that uses RtAudio
Advantage is that RtAudio changes samplerate on launch which can be annoying

The idea here is that you can have two ofSoundStreams:
input, say from, line-in
and play this through an output - eg headphones
so you can analyse an input source and write what you need to the output.

1. addons - uses a new add-on created by andrew Robertson, called ofxPortaudioSoundStream
It wraps a portaudio soundstream into a class so you can have multiple instances. It also needs ofxAudioEvent which is in ofxSoundstream, so please download that add-on separately

2.
Then you need the PortAudio compiled library. I put some instructions/comments in openframeworks forum on how I got PortAudio running on OF. In my file system, I added portaudio fouler to 
openframeworks007->libs

(this is included in the addToLibs folder, does that work?)

3.

you also need to add
audioUnit.frameworks

this should be done by adding existing frameworks, under action in x-code

4. The Xcode compiled library needs to be changed
../../../libs/openFrameworksCompiled/project/osx/CoreOF.xcconfig

In my XcodeConfig file I added two lines:
In header section:
HEADER_PORTAUDIO = "$(OF_PATH)/libs/portaudio/include"
And in Lib section:
LIB_PORTAUDIO = "$(OF_PATH)/libs/portaudio/lib/osx/libportaudio.a"
HEADER_PORTAUDIO = "$(OF_PATH)/libs/portaudio/include"//added include here

i.e. it looks like
LIB_POCOUTIL = "$(OF_PATH)/libs/poco/lib/osx/PocoUtil.a"
LIB_POCOXML = "$(OF_PATH)/libs/poco/lib/osx/PocoXML.a"
LIB_PORTAUDIO = "$(OF_PATH)/libs/portaudio/lib/osx/libportaudio.a"

5. I think you may have to recompile openFrameworks to successfully to (4.)

if so, I think(?) that you:
go to OF_7->libs->openFrameworksCompiled->Project->osx->openFrameworks.xcodeproj
open that. Change the Xcode.cponfig file as in (4.)
now compile

so I think it now can access portaudio. I think you would need to add portaudio, perhaps as in parts 2 and 3 aboveÉ.?



Please let me know if you either 
1. got this running
2. need some help
3. did something cool with it - that would be great to hear about either way!

Could I also ask that if this project is used in any way (event, installation etc), you please contact me andrew.robertson@eecs.qmul.ac.uk with information on this. It's very useful as we are publicly funded and need to give an impact statement on how our research work is used.

FILES:

portaudio - this ia a compiled library of portaudio for mac os x. Put this into the "openframeworks->libs" folder
data : contains a font used 

DEPENDENCIES:

ofxPortaudioSoundStream 

ofxSoundStream - it uses the ofxAudioevent from this so find the add-on ofxSoundStream for that
